What’s Working
- ✅ `phred/sports/espn.py` and `espn_dry_run.py` removed — ESPN logic now lives in `phred/sports/fetchers/espn.py`. All registry and test references updated.
- FAISS Indexing: save_index() is functioning across multiple pipelines.
- Pipeline Execution: Each module (injury, ranking, news, projection, custom_advice) is running without crashing.
- Semantic Advisor: Your Advisor class is now properly saving and reusing indexes.
- Terminal Output: Clear, expressive logs — I love the use of emojis for readability.

⚠️ Minor Warnings
- runpy RuntimeWarning: This is benign. It’s just Python warning you that the module was already loaded before execution. You can ignore it unless you’re doing dynamic reloading.
- encoder_attention_mask Deprecation: This is from HuggingFace’s transformers library. It’s warning that encoder_attention_mask will be removed in v4.55.0. You’re likely fine unless you’re customizing attention logic.

📦 ESPN Module Migration
- Legacy `phred.sports.espn` deprecated.
- Use `phred.sports.fetchers.espn` for all ESPN-related hooks and fetch logic.
- Registry entries and CLI diagnostics updated accordingly.

## 🧹 Module Cleanup

- ✅ `phred/sports/espn.py` and `espn_dry_run.py` removed — ESPN logic now lives in `phred/sports/fetchers/espn.py` for modular clarity.
- 🔄 Registry and dynamic imports updated to reflect new path.
- 📘 Contributor docs patched to reference `fetchers.espn`.

## 📦 Packaging Refreshed

- 🧼 `.egg-info` metadata rebuilt to remove stale references.
- ✅ Wheel built successfully: `phred-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`
- 🧪 Future-proofing: consider adding `phred doctor packaging` to audit manifest paths and build hygiene.

## 🧪 Coming Soon: `phred doctor`

- ✅ Validates semantic hook imports
- 🧼 Audits deprecated modules and packaging artifacts
- 🔍 Prints emoji-tiered feedback for onboarding clarity

### 🧠 Importing Feedback Helpers

To use `feedback_context`:

```python
from phred.utils.banner_utils import feedback_context

chmod +x dev_activate.sh
./dev_activate.sh
